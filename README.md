# Monty-hall
## Monty Hall problem simulator
The problem is that you are presented with 3 doors, 1 winner and 2 losing doors. You select one, and before opening it one of the losing doors is opened. You are then offered a choice between keeping the door you selected earlier and switching to the other unopened door.

This simulation will show that the odds of keeping a door in the monty hall problem gives lower odds of winning than switching.
